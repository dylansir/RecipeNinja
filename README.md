# RecipeNinja

An app designed to sneak through the bloggers yarns and get straight to the source(The recipe).

Trying to implement a scrape that will find where the Recipe's ingredients and method starts to display it on the UI. 
Nice and simple.

Had to redesign the app after the inevidable realisation that scraping is frowned upon. However, I still managed to implement
some of google's API services gson to scrape in a google friendly way.

Eventually will write a Jsoup parse query that will try to check for websites TOC's and whether they condone web scraping or not.
